# quadratic-equation-solver
This program can provide Real solutions of quadratic equations type: a*x^2 + b*x + c=0 with constants: a,b,c.
The quadraticEquation class includes:
public member functions: 
  1. getEquationConstants() function: which gets constants a,b,c 
  2. testDiscriminant_D() which tests the discriminant D weather if it's D>0 or D=0 or D<0.
      - if D>0 then two real solutions will be computed
      - if D=0 the one solution will be given by the program
      - if D<0 means there is no Real solution
